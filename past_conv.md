Okay, it seems the previous attempt to fix the issue didn't fully resolve it, and now there's a 403 Forbidden error on the root path (`http://localhost`) in addition to the 404 on `/home/`.

The task was interrupted before the `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up --build -d` commands could be executed properly. Let's retry those steps cleanly.

First, I'll ensure all containers are stopped and removed.

Okay, `docker-compose down` completed successfully, stopping and removing all containers and the network.

Now, I'll bring the services back up, rebuilding the images with the latest Dockerfile changes.

Okay, the build and restart completed successfully, but now we have a 403 Forbidden error on the root (`/`) and the 404 persists on `/home/`.

This combination suggests that Nginx is not finding the `index.html` file in the expected location (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).

- __403 on `/`:__ Nginx tries to serve the default index file (`index.html`) from the `root` directory (`/usr/share/nginx/html`). If it can't find `index.html` and directory listing is forbidden (default), it returns 403.
- __404 on `/home/`:__ The `try_files` directive tries `$uri` (`/home/`) and `$uri/` (`/home/`), fails, and then tries the fallback `/index.html`. Since `/index.html` isn't found at the root (as indicated by the 403), the fallback also fails, resulting in the final `=404`.

The issue likely stems from the structure of the built Angular application (especially since it seems to be an Angular Universal/SSR setup based on `angular.json`) and how it's copied into the Nginx container.

Looking back at `angular.json`, the build output path is `dist/frontend-app`. For an SSR build, the client-side assets (including `index.html`) are typically placed inside a `browser` subdirectory within that output path (i.e., `dist/frontend-app/browser`).

The current `frontend-app/Dockerfile` copies the *entire* `dist/frontend-app` directory: `COPY --from=build /app/dist/frontend-app /usr/share/nginx/html`

This results in the `index.html` file being located at `/usr/share/nginx/html/browser/index.html` inside the container, while the Nginx `root` directive in `frontend-app/nginx.conf` is set to `/usr/share/nginx/html`. Nginx is looking for `index.html` directly in `/usr/share/nginx/html`, not finding it, and causing the errors.

To fix this, I'll modify the `COPY` command in `frontend-app/Dockerfile` to copy only the contents of the `browser` subdirectory into the Nginx root.

Okay, the `frontend-app/Dockerfile` has been updated to copy the correct `browser` subdirectory from the build stage into the Nginx web root. This should place `index.html` where Nginx expects it.

Let's rebuild and restart the services again. First, stop the current ones.

Okay, the services have been rebuilt and restarted with the corrected `COPY` path in the Dockerfile. However, you're still encountering a 403 Forbidden error on the root path (`/`) and a 404 Not Found on `/home/`.

This strongly suggests that Nginx inside the frontend containers cannot find or access the `index.html` file at the expected location (`/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`).

Let's verify the contents of the Nginx web root directory inside one of the frontend containers to confirm if the files were copied correctly. I'll check inside `frontend1`.

Cline wants to execute this command:

```shell
docker-compose exec frontend1 ls -l /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

The `ls` command executed successfully but returned no output, which strongly indicates that the directory `/usr/share/nginx/html/` inside the `frontend1` container is empty.

This means the `COPY` command in the `frontend-app/Dockerfile` is not copying the files as expected: `COPY --from=build /app/dist/frontend-app/browser /usr/share/nginx/html`

The most likely reason is that the source directory `/app/dist/frontend-app/browser` does not exist in the build stage container after the `npm run build` command completes. The Angular build might be placing the output directly into `/app/dist/frontend-app` without the `browser` subdirectory.

I will revert the `COPY` command to copy the entire contents of the build output directory `/app/dist/frontend-app` into the Nginx web root.

You are absolutely right! My apologies, I made a mistake in the previous step by reverting the `COPY` command. The 403 error on `/` confirms that Nginx is looking for `index.html` in `/usr/share/nginx/html` but it's not there because the build output is likely inside a subdirectory (like `browser`).

Let's correct the `COPY` command in `frontend-app/Dockerfile` *back* to copying only the contents of the `browser` subdirectory, which should contain the client-side `index.html` and assets.
